# HackerRank: 30 Days of Code in C++

This repository contains my solutions to the [30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenge on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) using C++ programming language, aswell as Hackerrank problems done in Python. 

## About 30 Days of Code

The 30 Days of Code challenge is a series of programming exercises to help improve your coding skills. Each day, you'll be provided with a new problem to solve using your chosen programming language.

The problems range from basic programming concepts like loops and conditionals to more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

This repository contains solutions to problems from the 30 days of code challenge and hackerrank problems.

# 30 days of code problems:  
Each problem is solved using C++ and the solutions are organized in separate folders named `DayXX`, where `XX` represents the day number (e.g., `Day0`, `Day1`... `Day30`.

Inside each folder, you'll find a single C++ source file named based on the function of the file, dubbed `fileName.cpp` that contains the solution to the problem for that specific day.

# HackerRank problems:
Each problem is solved using Python and are sorted via category, and named according to their function. 
## Usage

# C++ problems:
To run the solutions on your local machine, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++` for Linux and macOS or Visual Studio for Windows). Compile and run the `solution.cpp` file for the respective day.

For example, to compile and run the solution for Day 1, navigate to the `Day 1` directory and execute the following commands:

```sh
g++ -o solution solution.cpp
./solution
```
Replace g++ and the corresponding commands with the appropriate compiler and commands for your operating system if necessary.

# HackerRank (Python) problems
To run the solutions on your local machine, make sure you have python installed. To run a problem, execute the following commands:
`python3 main.py`
